\textbf{Problem 2:} Sample a time series of length~$T=30$ from the Gaussian LDS in Problem 1 with parameters~$a=1, b=0, q=0.1, r=0.3$.  Plot the sample of~$x_{1:T}$ as a solid line, and plot the observed~$y_{1:T}$ as $\mathsf{+}$'s.  Write code to compute the filtered distribution~$p(x_t \mid y_{1:t})$ you derived in Problem 1.  Then plot the mean of the filtered distribution~$\bbE[x_t \mid y_{1:t}]$ over time as a solid line, and plot a shaded region encompassing the mean $\pm 2$ standard deviations of the filtered distribution.  All plots should be on the same axis.  Include a legend.

Write your code in a Colab notebook and include a PDF printout of your notebook as well as the raw .ipynb file.
